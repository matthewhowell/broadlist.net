# The Purpose of Broadlist

*Broadlist* exists to help readers find books to read.

It is a collection of books which have been included in longlists, shortlists, and literary prizes from all over the world. 

## Public Goals

1. <a href="">*Broadlist* will help readers find good books</a>
2. *Broadlist* will be a good website
3. *Broadlist* will give away its data
3. *Broadlist* will do no harm

### 1. *Broadlist* will help readers find good books

Broadlist is here to for readers of books. It will spend its time and effort focused on readers and their needs.

### 2. *Broadlist* will be a good website

Broadlist, in order to be useful to readers of books, will be a good website.

It will be accessible, fast, reliable, and secure. It will be nice to use.

### 3. *Broadlist* will give away its data

The core work of Broadlist is collecting, normalizing, and ever-so-slightly editorializing data from other organizations. This data is public. We, as a project or a website, do not own any of this data.

Every list that Broadlist collects is [available as a feed](/feeds) and in an free and open-source, documented, plaintext file format called *booklist*. Broadlist maintains a free and open-source booklist parser. You can grab any booklist file by appending /booklist the URL of a list. Example: [1969 Booker Prize](/lists/booker-prize/1969.booklist)

If Broadlist ceases to exist at any point, it could be reconstructed from these files.

If someone wants to make a better Broadlist and would like to use our collected data to do so, we acknowledge that doing so is a legitimate pursuit.

### 4. *Broadlist* will do no harm

When making decisions, *Broadlist* will prioritize its own values.
