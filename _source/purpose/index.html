<h3 id="1-broadlist-will-help-readers-find-good-books">1. <em>Broadlist</em> will help readers find good books</h3>
<p>Broadlist is here to for readers of books. It will spend its time and effort focused on readers and their needs.</p>
<h3 id="2-broadlist-will-be-a-good-website">2. <em>Broadlist</em> will be a good website</h3>
<p>Broadlist, in order to be useful to readers of books, will be a good website.</p>
<p>It will be accessible, fast, reliable, and secure. It will be nice to use.</p>
<h3 id="3-broadlist-will-give-away-its-data">3. <em>Broadlist</em> will give away its data</h3>
<p>The core work of Broadlist is collecting, normalizing, and ever-so-slightly editorializing data from other organizations. This data is public. We, as a project or a website, do not own any of this data.</p>
<p>Every list that Broadlist collects is <a href="/feeds">available as a feed</a> and in an free and open-source, documented, plaintext file format called <em>booklist</em>. Broadlist maintains a free and open-source booklist parser. You can grab any booklist file by appending /booklist the URL of a list. Example: <a href="/lists/booker-prize/1969.booklist">1969 Booker Prize</a></p>
<p>If Broadlist ceases to exist at any point, it could be reconstructed from these files.</p>
<p>If someone wants to make a better Broadlist and would like to use our collected data to do so, we acknowledge that doing so is a legitimate pursuit.</p>
<h3 id="4-broadlist-will-do-no-harm">4. <em>Broadlist</em> will do no harm</h3>
<p>When making decisions, <em>Broadlist</em> will prioritize its own values.</p>
