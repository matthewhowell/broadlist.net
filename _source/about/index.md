	- If you find anything incorrect, please let us know.

- Can I request that my book be listed on Broadlist?
	- Not directly. Broadlist does not make editorial decisions about the books that it lists.
- Can I create my own list or award and then request Broadlist to aggregate it?
	- You can certainly try! The world could always use more thoughtful critiques. If you want to create your own fiction prize, for example, Broadlist does not discourage this.
